# Diabetes Prediction using Deep Learning
Diabetes is a medical condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high. Diabetes prevalence in the UK is estimated to rise to 5 million by 2025. Quick and early diagnosis is beneficial to treating the disease. Deep learning and machine learning have been extensively applied in medical diagnosis. This project aims to critically evaluate and perform a comparative analysis on two key supervised learning algorithms â€“ multi layer perceptron(MLP) and support vector machines(SVM) , on a classification task on the Pima Indian diabetes dataset. The support vector machines are evaluated in comparisons with different kernel functions. We perform hyperparameter tuning using grid search and Bayesian optimisation for both algorithms with stratified k-fold cross validation, oversampling of minority class and evaluate and compare model performance using confusion matrix and ROC curves.
